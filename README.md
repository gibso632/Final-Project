# Using a Weighted Overlay Analysis to Determine Optimal Paths for Summitting

This repository includes the documentation, notebooks, and an ArcGIS Online Experience Builder Web Application linked below for visualizing the output optimal paths for high-pointing 11 state highpoints in the United States. This project uses a weighted overlay analysis to create optimal paths for hikers using 10-meter spatial resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and land cover datasets. Any raster datasets can be used for the study, however DEM data from the [USGS National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/) and the [ESRI Sentinel-2 Land Cover Explorer](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcoverexplorer/#mapCenter=39.186%2C9.042%2C10&mode=step&timeExtent=2017%2C2022&year=2020&downloadMode=true) is recommended.
