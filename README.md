# Using a Weighted Overlay Analysis to Determine Optimal Paths for Summitting

This repository includes the documentation, notebooks, and an ArcGIS Pro project for performing an open-source analysis of this study. This project uses a weighted overlay analysis to create optimal paths for hikers using 10-meter spatial resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and land cover datasets. Any raster datasets can be used for the study, however DEM data from the [USGS National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/) and the ESRI Sentinel-2 Land Cover Explorer is recommended.
